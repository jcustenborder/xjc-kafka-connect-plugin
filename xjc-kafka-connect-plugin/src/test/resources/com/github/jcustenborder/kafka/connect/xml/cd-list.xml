             <p>The album was recorded in the midst of Coltrane's residency at the
Five Spot as a member of the Thelonious Monk quartet. The personnel
include Coltrane's once and future Miles Davis bandmates, Paul
Chambers on bass and Philly Joe Jones on drums. Pianist Kenny Drew had
released a trio album the year before on Riverside Records with
Chambers and Jones as his sidemen. Both trumpeter Lee Morgan and
trombonist Curtis Fuller were up-and-coming jazz musicians, and both
would be members of Art Blakey's Jazz Messengers, although not
together.</p>
