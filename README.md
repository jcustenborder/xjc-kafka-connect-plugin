# Introduction

xjc-kafka-connect-plugin is used to extend code generated by xjc. All type classes generated by xjc will be augmented to
implement the [Connectable](https://github.com/jcustenborder/xjc-kafka-connect-plugin/kafka-connect-xml/src/main/java/com/github/jcustenborder/kafka/connect/xml/Connectable.java) 
interface. The following method is added to each of the classes that are generated by xjc. This will return a Struct that
is populated with the graph of the object.  



```java
    @Override
    public Struct toConnectStruct() {
        Struct struct = new Struct(CONNECT_SCHEMA);
        struct.put("author", this.getAuthor());
        struct.put("title", this.getTitle());
        struct.put("genre", this.getGenre());
        struct.put("price", this.getPrice());
        if (null!= this.getPubDate()) {
            struct.put("pub_date", this.getPubDate().toGregorianCalendar(TimeZone.getTimeZone("UTC"), null, null).getTime());
        } else {
            struct.put("pub_date", null);
        }
        struct.put("review", this.getReview());
        struct.put("id", this.getId());
        return struct;
    }
```
